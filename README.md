# Forms in Flask

In this Flask app we will demonstrate the basics of processing forms and also using a form library called WT Forms.

## Setup

To Run this application, ensure you have installed Python 3 and follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your development environment.
2. Change to the directory (e.g. `cd flask-forms`)
3. Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`. In some cases you may need to use `python3 -m venv venv`.
4. Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate` or on Windows use `.\venv\Scripts\activate`.
5. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Once that is finished, start the built-in development server using `flask --debug run`.
7. Next, open your web browser and go to **http://127.0.0.1:5000/** , you should see the Flask forms webpage displayed.

Note: If you added a `.env` file and changed the `FLASK_RUN_PORT` value then you will need to change the port in the URL in step 7.
